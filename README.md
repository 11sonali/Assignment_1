Data Collection and Curation

Goal of project:
The goal of this project was to construct, analyze, and publish a dataset. Since there has been a huge increase in hybrid breeding of dogs for non-sheding coats, I was curious about dog ownership and the types of dogs owners had in two area dog parks: Hancock Dog Park and Norwood Estate Dog Park. Through surveying people entering the dog park, questions were asked and responses recorded.

License:
For my data a license was not needed because I collected my own data without using an API.

Data type and description for each attribute:
The data type collected through the surveys was Qualitative and both Nominal & Ordinal for certain attributes. Below is a list of the survey questions asked of each dog owner. At the end of each question the possible yes/no response is identified as either nominal or ordinal data.
  1) Is this your ownly pet? Nominal
  2) Is this your first pet? Nominal
  3) Does the dog live in an apartment or house? Nominal
  4) Dog has more than one owner? Ordinal
  5) Are you in school or not? Nominal
  6) Dog size/under 20 pounds or not? Ordinal
  7) Shedding breed? Nominal
  
The data description for each attribute is whether dog owners answered yes or no to the survey questions, in either Hancock Dog Park or Norwood Estate Dog park. Further clarification on the meaning of each question is described below.
  1) Is this your only pet?
     Asked to find out if respondent has other pets that may influence the type of dog they own.
  2) Is this your first pet?
     Asked because experiences dog owners know about the amount of hair dogs shed.
  3) Does the dog live in an apartment or house?
     Asked because size of residence impacts how much dog hair there is to clean.
  4) Dog has more than one owner?
     Asked because having multiple owners helps in maintenence of dog, such as time it takes to groom and clean any shedding in residence.
  5) Are you in school or not?
     Asked because this may impact the amount of time an owner has to take care of a dog.
  6) Dog size/under 20 pounds or not?
     Asked because the size of dog impacts the amount of hair shed.
  7) Shedding breed?
     Asked to see if hybrid dog breeds with non-shedding coats are chosen more often.
